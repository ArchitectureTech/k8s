Scaling PODS

If your application is stateless you can horizontally scale it.
Stateless = app doesn't keep any local files and keeps local sessions.
            your application doesn't have state.

All traditional Dbs are Stateful .
  they have database files that can't be split over multiple instances.

Most web applications can be made stateless...
  Sessions management needs to be done outside the container.
  can use Redis, or a database or MemCache.

Any files that need to be saved can't be saved locally on the container.

Volumes can run stateful apps
  Those stateful apps can't horizontally scale, but you can run them in a single
  container and vertically scale (allocate more CPU/Memory/Disk).

  Scaling apps on-premise and in the cloud.

Scaling done via Replication controller
 The Replication controller will ensure a specified number of
 pod replicas will run at all times.
 All pods created with the replica controller will automatically be replaced
 if they fail, get deleted , or are terminated.

 Using a replication controller is recommended if you want to make sure at least 1 pod
 is always running, even after reboots.
 - then run the replication controller with just 1 replica.

 To run a replication controller change the pod defition to specify replicationController
 and add the appropriate additional fields.
